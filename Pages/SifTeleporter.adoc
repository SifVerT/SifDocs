Adds a teleporter pad to the game and lets players move around the map instantly between different pads, after a short but energy-wise costly charge-up period.

Balanced, uses a lot of energy while charging for the teleporter jump. It is part of progression as a milestone at the HUB and unlocked at Tier 6 under an unlock called 'High-Tech Transport'. Hence not meant as a cheat mod but as a means of transport between your outposts in end-game when moving around your industry empire starts to become too mundane.

Tip: Use Power Storages if you don't have a lot of surplus power. This is highly recommended in order to cope with the spike power demand which you only have during a fairly short time. This was added to make the mod pretty balanced.

Planned: 

- <s>Balance the mod when it comes to power cost, it is arguably too cheap to jump currently (1 GW for 1000 meters but next version will rmp it up to 5GW/1km).</s> Fixed 1.1.0
- More tiers of teleporter types (for example: teleport items or even vehicles, also in a balanced way being energy-wise costly)
- <s>A visual effect when teleporting (coming soon thanks to D4rkL0rd - the dev of Structural Solutions and Linear Motion).</s> - Early draft added 1.1.0, D4rkL0rd will improve the quality soon

<b>Works in multiplayer.</b>
