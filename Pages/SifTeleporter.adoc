Adds a teleporter pad to the game and lets players move around the map instantly between different pads, after a short but energy-wise costly charge-up period.

Balanced, uses a lot of energy while charging for the teleporter jump. It is part of progression as a milestone at the HUB and unlocked at Tier 6 under an unlock called 'High-Tech Transport'. Hence not meant as a cheat mod but as a means of transport between your outposts in end-game when moving around your industry empire starts to become too mundane.

Tip: Use Power Storages if you don't have a lot of surplus power. This is highly recommended in order to cope with the spike power demand which you only have during a fairly short time. This was added to make the mod pretty balanced.

Works in multiplayer.
